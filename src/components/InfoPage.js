      fragile ecosystem in eastern India and Bangladesh. It follows 
      Piya, a marine biologist from the U.S. studying the endangered 
      Irrawaddy dolphins, and Kanai, a translator from Delhi. As 
      their paths cross with local fisherman Fokir, the novel explores
      the tension between human survival, environmental conservation,
      and cultural identity.The story beautifully blends science, nature,
      and society, revealing the struggles of marginalized communities
      living in a land constantly threatened by floods, tigers, and poverty.
